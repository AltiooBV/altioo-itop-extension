# Builds the release archive from this working copy, and checks it.
#
# One script for every place an archive is built - ci.yml's package job on
# every change, release.yml at a tag, and the template's own self-test - so
# that what CI proves buildable and what a release publishes are the same
# thing. They used to be two inline lists that disagreed: CI checked five
# files, the release checked eighteen, and the eighteen were one extension's
# (an HTTP entry point, its guard files, a client document). Every other
# extension built from this template passed CI and then could not publish.
#
# Expects vendor/ to be the production tree already:
#
#   composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader && tools/ci/build-archive.sh
#
# Leaves at the repository root: <module>-<version>.zip, its .sha256,
# sbom.cyclonedx.json and licenses.json. When GITHUB_OUTPUT is set it also
# writes name=<module>-<version> and module=<module> there.
